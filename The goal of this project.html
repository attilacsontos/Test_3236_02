# The aim of the project

## This project aims to build a community-centred environment for remote workers, an environment that is primarily about cybersecurity-related topics.

We are talking and sending our message to self-employed people who are just learning about remote work and who, in addition to the advantages of remote work, feel and know that acquiring and developing knowledge about cyber security is essential for a successful business life, whatever the company's profile is.

In addition, they do not just want to consume the content created here; they also want to share their experiences actively and would like to participate in developing and increasing the content created here.
The cloud-based repository hosting service, GitHub, is an excellent tool to achieve this goal. On this platform, we can openly share and improve the content while increasing the community in terms of number and activity.

We do hope that the content prepared here will be beneficial for those who do not yet have the proper routine of remote work or sole proprietorship and who miss content on the Internet about the cyber security aspects of this kind of work.

We feel that this project fills a real gap since finding content on the Internet about cybersecurity issues for workers in this situation is challenging. Therefore, we encourage our dear readers to take an active part in this project and share their experiences so that the content of the platform is as up-to-date and helpful as possible for those who are just starting this type of activity, suffer from a lack of information and the information you can read here can provide solutions to their everyday problems.
